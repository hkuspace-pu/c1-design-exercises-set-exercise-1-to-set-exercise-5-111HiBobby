The final UI design for the staff side is using Java and Android Studio to create a high-fidelity prototype.
- The interfaces should be interactive, and all links should be functional (there is no need to connect to
a database at this stage).
- Active menus and icons must also be interactive.
- Notifications should be displayed to inform users based on their preferences.
